## Information Archetypes Interview Benchmarking Handbook


This is a handbook of definitions and examples of information dimensions found in interview data that can be used as benchmarks in the rating process. The quotes here are examples of characteristics included in the coding scheme. This handbook should be used with the rater’s own notes compiled during the various training sessions.

Each dimension presented in the handbook has a level associated with it (high/ low). Definitions of the dimension are provided, along with explanations for each of the levels. Examples of quotes that correspond to each level are then provided for reference. These examples are used as benchmarks by the rater during coding in order to categorize sentences/ segments into the appropriate category.

NOTE: A single sentence/ segment can be categorized as belonging to more than 1 dimension in this coding scheme.

### 1.	Information Source

The origin of the information with respect to the individual or the individual’s organization that generated the idea. Partially describes idea ownership.

Internal (to Entity): Information comes from within the individual or the individual’s organization’s own cognition. Information has no to minimal inspiration from beyond the designer at the time of the information gathering or idea generation.

e.g., Past experiences with products, autobiographical knowledge gained from experience or expertise (i.e., cannot be traced to a specific instance/ event where the information was obtained from another source), personal heuristics, individual preferences, etc.

External (to Entity): Information comes from outside the individual or the individual’s organization’s own cognition. Information has most if not all inspiration from beyond the organization at the time of information gathering or idea generation.

e.g., Examples of other successful products, episodic knowledge gained from a past experience (i.e., can be traced to a specific instance/ event where the information obtained came from another source), recommendations from other designers or colleagues, best practices obtained from guidelines, etc.


### 2.	Abstraction of Information

The level of abstraction of the information. Describes the extent to which the information deals with ideas vs events. Partially captures the level of detail found in the information.

Abstract: (Ideas and Concepts) Information is highly conceptual and deals with ideas and concepts instead of concrete details.

e.g. Information deals with general information about a design process , training programs , and so on .

Concrete: (Concrete Details) Information deals with concrete details and instantiations.

e.g. Information deals with specific features of the product, specifications, etc.
 

### 3.	Generality of Information

The level of generalizability of the information to other design tasks and projects. The extent to which the information used is directly related to the domain of interest, as opposed to other more distant domains.

Domain Specific: (Closely Related to Domain) Information is highly related to the domain of the product being designed.

e.g., When designing a video playing application, inspiration is sourced from other video playing applications.

Cross-Cutting: (Standards and Common Issues) Information is relevant across many design problems.  

e.g., Designing new training materials of a software used by employees working in different departments.   


### 4.	Effectuation of Information

The extent to which the information deals with the resources available to the designer or with the end goal of the product. Describes whether the information is the “means” or the “ends” of the design process.

Effectual: (Resources Available) Information deals with resources available to the designer during the design process.

e.g., Current domain or design expertise, available prototyping facilities, financial capital, social capital, etc.

Causal: (End Goal) Information deals with the end goal of the design process or the needs the product aims to fill.  

e.g., Customer needs of designed product, other competing products, trends in the market, etc.


 
### 5.	Representation of Information

The form in which the information is obtained, or the manner in which the inspiration is articulated.

Synchronous (Real-Time): (In-person, phone, etc…) Information was obtained in-person, on the phone, etc…

Asynchronous (Near-Real-Time): (email, chat, blog, trace data, etc…) Information was obtained from email, text/chat, blogs, electronic trace data, etc...
