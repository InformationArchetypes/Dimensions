## Information Archetypes Interview Benchmarking Handbook


This is a handbook of definitions and examples of information dimensions found in interview data that can be used as benchmarks in the rating process. The quotes here are examples of characteristics included in the coding scheme. This handbook should be used with the rater’s own notes compiled during the various training sessions.

Each dimension presented in the handbook has two sub-levels associated with it. Definitions of the dimensions as well as the sub-levels are provided. Examples of quotes that correspond to each level are then provided for reference. These examples are used as benchmarks by the rater during coding in order to categorize sentences/ segments into the appropriate category.

NOTE: A single sentence/ segment can be categorized as belonging to more than 1 dimension in this coding scheme.

### 1.	Information Source

Information Source refers to the origin of the information with respect to the individual or the individual’s organization that generated the idea. Partially describes idea ownership.

Internal (to Entity): Information that comes from within the individual or the individual’s organization’s own cognition. Information has no to minimal inspiration from beyond the designer/organization at the time of the information gathering or idea generation.

For example: Past experiences with products, autobiographical knowledge gained from experience or expertise (i.e., cannot be traced to a specific instance/ event where the information was obtained from another source), personal heuristics, individual preferences, intellectual property, etc.

QUOTE:

External (to Entity): Information that comes from outside the individual or the individual’s organization’s own cognition. Information has most, if not all, inspiration from beyond the designer/organization at the time of information gathering or idea generation.

For example: Examples of other successful products, episodic knowledge gained from a past experience (i.e., can be traced to a specific instance/ event where the information obtained came from another source), recommendations from other designers or colleagues, best practices obtained from guidelines, etc.

QUOTE:

### 2.	Abstraction of Information

Abstraction of Information refers to the level of abstraction of the information. Describes the extent to which the information deals with ideas vs events. Partially captures the level of detail found in the information (low detail signals abstraction, high detail signals concrete).

Abstract: (Ideas and Concepts) Information that is highly conceptual and deals with ideas and concepts instead of concrete details.

For example: Information that deals with general information about a design process, etc.

QUOTE:

Concrete: (Concrete details) Information which deals with concrete details and instantiations.

For example: Information that deals with specific features of the product, specifications, requirements, etc.

QUOTE:

### 3.	Generality of Information

The Generality of Information deals with the level of generalizability of the information to other design tasks and projects. The extent to which the information is directly related to the domain of interest, as opposed to other more distant domains.

Domain Specific: (Closely related to the domain of interest) Information that is highly related to the domain of the design engagement (whatever is being designed).

For example: When designing a video playing application (e.g. QuickTime, Windows Media Player, VLC), inspiration is sourced from other video playing applications.

QUOTE:

Cross-Cutting: (Standards and common issues) Information that is relevant and applicable across many design problems.  

For example: Designing new training materials of a software that will be used by employees working in different departments.

QUOTE:


### 4.	Effectuation of Information

The	Effectuation of Information refers to the extent to which the information deals with the resources available to the designer versus with the end goal(s) of the design. Describes whether the information is the “means” or the “ends” of the design process.

Means: (Effectual) Information that deals with resources available to the designer during the design process. Available resources determine the design decisions.

For example: Design decisions are made based on the current domain of design expertise, available prototyping facilities, financial/social/technical capital, etc.

QUOTE:

Ends: (Causal) Information that deals with the end goal of the design process or the needs that the product aims to fulfill. The end goal of the design shapes the design decisions.

For example: Design decisions are made based on the customer needs of designed product, other competing products, trends in the market, etc.

QUOTE:

 
### 5.	Representation of Information

The form in which the information is obtained, or the manner in which the inspiration is articulated.

Synchronous: (Real-Time) Information that was obtained in real-time. In other words, there is an instant interaction between the sender and the receiver of the message, and that interaction can include verbal and non-verbal cues.

For example: In-person conversations, phone calls, conferences, real-time video meetings, etc.

QUOTE:

Asynchronous: (Near-Real-Time) Information that was obtained from communication channels that allow for a delay in response.

For example: Emails, chat, blogs, trace data, publications, etc.
