# Information Archetypes & Dimensions in Design

This repository provides complementary files related to Information Archetypes in Design research project. This project explores the types of information that designers use to make decisions. This interdisciplinary research team explores design through experimentation and observation utilizing many different methods, including, field study, participatory design, lab experiments. Specifically, this work has explored open design, an emerging area of research around open and distributed design engagements.
